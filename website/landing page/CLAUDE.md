This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

TakeOff Media is an AI-powered SEO automation platform targeting solopreneurs and small businesses. The repository contains business strategy, marketing materials, and content assets rather than application code.

**Mission**: "Outrank. Outshine. Outlast." - Automated SEO, built for solo entrepreneurs.

## Repository Structure

- `business_overview.md` - Core business model, features, pricing, and go-to-market strategy
- `assets/copywriting_principles.md` - World-class copywriting guidelines and principles
- `website/landing page/` - Landing page HTML and copy materials
- `research/` - Market research, keyword analysis, and competitive intelligence
- `Media/` - Brand assets including logos and social media graphics

## Content Guidelines

When working with marketing copy and content:

1. **Brand Voice**: Direct, confident, anti-agency positioning. Emphasize simplicity ("1-click"), automation, and value for solopreneurs
2. **Target Audience**: Solopreneurs, startup founders, e-commerce owners, indie creators, SaaS marketers
3. **Key Differentiators**: Full-stack automation, no agency overhead, brand-first customization, future-proof SEO
4. **Pricing Structure**: Starter ($99/mo), Growth ($299/mo), Pro ($499/mo)

## Copywriting Standards

Follow the principles in `assets/copywriting_principles.md`:
- Clarity over cleverness (5th-grade reading level)
- Hook attention in first 3 seconds
- Write to one person using "you"
- Tap into core human drives (status, security, money, time)
- Use social proof strategically
- Create urgency and scarcity
- Make value obvious and remove risk
- Sell transformation, not product features

## Business Context

- **Problem**: SEO is expensive ($3K-$15K/month agencies), complex, and time-consuming
- **Solution**: 1-click platform generating 30+ SEO blogs, images, alt text, and social content
- **Market Position**: "The Canva of SEO content" - visual-first, fast, beginner-friendly
- **Competition**: Nytro SEO, SEO.AI, SurferSEO, and other fragmented AI SEO tools
- **Go-to-Market**: Pre-launch validation → MVP beta → referral-based growth

When editing content, maintain consistency with the established brand voice and ensure all copy aligns with the core value proposition of simplified, automated SEO for solo entrepreneurs.
